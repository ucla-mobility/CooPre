This is the official implementation of IROS 2025 paper "CooPre: Cooperative Pretraining for V2X Cooperative Perception". In this paper, we present a multi-agent self-supervised learning framwork for V2X cooperative perception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data to enhance the perception performance. Our study underscores the critical role of well-learned 3D representations as a promising complement to task-specific design optimizations in V2X cooperative perception.
