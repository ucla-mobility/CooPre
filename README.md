This is the official implementation of IROS 2025 paper "CooPre: Cooperative Pretraining for V2X Cooperative Perception". In this paper, we present a multi-agent self-supervised learning framwork for V2X cooperative perception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data to enhance the perception performance. Our study underscores the critical role of well-learned 3D representations as a promising complement to task-specific design optimizations in V2X cooperative perception.

## Tutorial
#### Environment setup
Please refer to the following steps for the environment setup:
```shell
# Create conda environment (python >= 3.7)
conda create -n coopre python=3.8
conda activate coopre
# pytorch installation
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
